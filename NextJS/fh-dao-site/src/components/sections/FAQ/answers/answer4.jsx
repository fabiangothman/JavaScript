      <p>Blockchain technology can require immense amounts of energy, which can contribute to emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, since most of energy grids are still powered by fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>However — there are numerous ways to mitigate this problem, from using energy-efficient chains, to leveraging effective offsetting.</p>
      <p>Since Future Quest DAO exists to help solve the climate change crisis, we commit to carbon-negative operations across our organization.</p>
      <p>We are in conversations with several potential technology platforms, and will soon determine the exact chain we will use to build the DAO and run its operations.</p>
      <p>We are also working closely with partners in the space (PlanA, TrueCarbon, Toucan, and more) to determine the most effective approaches to offsetting.</p>
